If you were asked to create a simple PDDL {action_name} action, what predicates from this list would you need?:

{predicate_list}

The recipe to craft sticks in Minecraft is: {nl_domain}

Base the predicates you select on the following summary of a generic Minecraft action: {p1} {p2}

Don’t repeat predicates or change the predicates I have given you in any way. You must follow this rule. For
example, if the predicates you selected were (IsMammal ?someanimal - animal) and (IsInsect ?somebug - bug)
from the list (IsMammal ?someanimal - animal) (IsInsect ?somebug - bug) (IsPlant ?someplant - plant), you
would answer as “‘(IsMammal ?someanimal - animal), (IsInsect ?somebug - bug)“‘, where each predicate only
appears a single time and has not been changed. For example, (IsMammal ?someanimal - animal) did not become
(IsMammal ?someanimal1 - animal) and (IsMammal ?someanimal2 - animal).

End your final answers starting with "### New Predicates" with ''' ''' comment blocks in PDDL as so:

### New Predicates
```
- (predicate_name_1 ?t1 - type_1 ?t2 - type_2): 'predicate_description'
- (predicate_name_2 ?t3 - type_3 ?t4 - type_4): 'predicate_description'
- (predicate_name_3 ?t5 - type_5): 'predicate_description'
```
