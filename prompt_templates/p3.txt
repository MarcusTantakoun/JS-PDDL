The recipe to {action_name} in Minecraft is: {nl_domain}

If you were asked to create a simple PDDL {action_name} action, which of these types would you need?

The types you can choose from are: 
{object_hierarchy}

Base the types you select on the following summary of a generic Minecraft action: {p1} {p2}

End your final answer starting with "## OUTPUT" and then the Python dictionary pair '{'name':'description'}' as so:

## OUTPUT
{
    "type_1": "description",
    "type_2": "description",
    "type_3": "description",
}
