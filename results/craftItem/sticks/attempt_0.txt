LLM OUTPUTS:

[STAGE ONE OUTPUT]:
The `craftItem` function automates the crafting process in Minecraft by directing a bot to craft a specified item using a crafting table. It first identifies the item and locates the nearest crafting table within a 32-block radius. The bot then navigates to the crafting table, retrieves the appropriate recipe for the item, and executes the crafting operation for the specified quantity.

[STAGE TWO OUTPUT]:
The goal is to automate item crafting; preconditions include having a placed crafting table; effects are the bot crafts the specified item quantity.

[STAGE THREE OUTPUT]:
To create a simple PDDL action for crafting sticks in Minecraft, we need to consider the relevant types involved in the action. Since the action does not require a crafting table and involves transforming wood planks into sticks, the relevant types would be:

1. **player**: The entity performing the action.
2. **plankBlock**: The resource required to perform the action.
3. **stickItem**: The result of the action.

Based on the given summary and the nature of the action, we can ignore types related to crafting tables and other items not directly involved in crafting sticks.

## OUTPUT
```python
{
    "player": "The entity performing the crafting action",
    "plankBlock": "The resource required to craft sticks",
    "stickItem": "The result of the crafting action"
}
```

[STAGE FOUR OUTPUT]:
Based on the given information and the requirement to craft sticks from wood planks without needing a crafting table, the relevant predicates from the list are:

- (HasPlankBlock ?agent - player ?plank - plankBlock)
- (HasStickItem ?agent - player ?stick - stickItem)

### New Predicates
```
- (HasPlankBlock ?agent - player ?plank - plankBlock): 'The player has an individual plank block.'
- (HasStickItem ?agent - player ?stick - stickItem): 'The player has an individual stick item.'
```

[STAGE FIVE OUTPUT]:
Here's a PDDL action for crafting sticks in Minecraft using the specified types and predicates:

### Action Parameters
```
- ?agent - player: 'the player performing the crafting action'
- ?plank1 - plankBlock: 'the first plank block used for crafting sticks'
- ?plank2 - plankBlock: 'the second plank block used for crafting sticks'
- ?stick - stickItem: 'the resulting stick item from crafting'
```

### Action Preconditions
```
(and
    (HasPlankBlock ?agent ?plank1) ; The player has the first individual plank block
    (HasPlankBlock ?agent ?plank2) ; The player has the second individual plank block
    (not (= ?plank1 ?plank2)) ; Ensure the two plank blocks are distinct
)
```

### Action Effects
```
(and
    (not (HasPlankBlock ?agent ?plank1)) ; The player no longer has the first plank block
    (not (HasPlankBlock ?agent ?plank2)) ; The player no longer has the second plank block
    (HasStickItem ?agent ?stick) ; The player has a stick item
)
```
