[STAGE ONE OUTPUT]:
The `craftItem` function automates the crafting process in Minecraft by directing a bot to craft a specified item a given number of times. It first identifies the item and locates a nearby crafting table. The bot then navigates to the crafting table and uses the appropriate recipe to craft the item the specified number of times.

[STAGE TWO OUTPUT]:
The `craftItem` function aims to automate item crafting by requiring a placed crafting table, guiding the bot to craft specified items using identified recipes.

[STAGE THREE OUTPUT]:
To create a simple PDDL action for crafting sticks in Minecraft, we need to consider the types involved in the action. The action requires two wood planks and results in four sticks. No crafting table is needed, and the player is involved in the action. Therefore, the relevant types are:

1. `player`: Represents the player who performs the crafting action.
2. `plankBlock`: Represents the wood planks used in the crafting process.
3. `stickItem`: Represents the sticks produced as a result of the crafting action.

Given these considerations, the types needed for the PDDL action are `player`, `plankBlock`, and `stickItem`.

## OUTPUT
{
    "player": "Represents the player performing the crafting action",
    "plankBlock": "Represents the wood planks used in crafting",
    "stickItem": "Represents the sticks produced from crafting"
}

[STAGE FOUR OUTPUT]:
Based on the given information, the action of crafting sticks from wood planks in Minecraft requires the player to have two individual planks and results in the player having four individual sticks. The relevant predicates from the list provided are those that relate to the possession of planks and sticks. Since no crafting table is needed, predicates related to crafting tables are not required.

The relevant predicates are:

- (HasPlankBlock ?agent - player ?plank - plankBlock)
- (HasStickItem ?agent - player ?stick - stickItem)

These predicates are necessary to define the preconditions and effects of the action. The precondition is that the player must have two planks, and the effect is that the player will have four sticks.

### New Predicates
```
- (HasPlankBlock ?agent - player ?plank - plankBlock): 'Indicates that the player has a plank block.'
- (HasStickItem ?agent - player ?stick - stickItem): 'Indicates that the player has a stick item.'
```

[STAGE FIVE OUTPUT]:
Here is the PDDL action for crafting sticks in Minecraft based on the given requirements:

### Action Parameters
```
- ?agent - player: 'The player performing the crafting action'
- ?plank1 - plankBlock: 'The first plank block used in crafting'
- ?plank2 - plankBlock: 'The second plank block used in crafting'
- ?stick - stickItem: 'The stick item resulting from crafting'
```

### Action Preconditions
```
(and
    (HasPlankBlock ?agent ?plank1) ; The player has the first plank block
    (HasPlankBlock ?agent ?plank2) ; The player has the second plank block
    (not (= ?plank1 ?plank2)) ; The two plank blocks must be distinct
)
```

### Action Effects
```
(and
    (not (HasPlankBlock ?agent ?plank1)) ; The first plank block is used up
    (not (HasPlankBlock ?agent ?plank2)) ; The second plank block is used up
    (HasStickItem ?agent ?stick) ; The player gains a stick item
)
```

### New Predicates
```
``` 

This action ensures that the player has two distinct plank blocks before crafting and results in the player obtaining a stick item while consuming the plank blocks.
