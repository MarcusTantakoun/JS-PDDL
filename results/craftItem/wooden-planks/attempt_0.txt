[STAGE ONE OUTPUT]:
The `craftItem` function automates the crafting process in Minecraft by directing a bot to craft a specified item using a crafting table. It first identifies the item and locates a nearby crafting table within a 32-block radius. The bot then navigates to the crafting table and retrieves the appropriate recipe for the item. Finally, it executes the crafting operation for the specified quantity.

[STAGE TWO OUTPUT]:
The `craftItem` function aims to automate item crafting using a crafting table, requiring a nearby table and resulting in the specified item being crafted.

[STAGE THREE OUTPUT]:
To create a simple PDDL action for crafting wooden planks in Minecraft, we need to consider the types involved in the action. The action involves a player using wood blocks to create plank blocks. Since no crafting table is needed, we can exclude the `craftTable` type. The relevant types for this action are `player`, `woodBlock`, and `plankBlock`.

Here's the breakdown of the types needed:

1. **player**: Represents the entity performing the crafting action.
2. **woodBlock**: Represents the input material required for crafting planks.
3. **plankBlock**: Represents the output product of the crafting action.

## OUTPUT
```python
{
    "player": "Represents the entity performing the crafting action",
    "woodBlock": "Represents the input material required for crafting planks",
    "plankBlock": "Represents the output product of the crafting action",
}
```

[STAGE FOUR OUTPUT]:
To create a simple PDDL action for crafting wooden planks from wood blocks, we need to focus on the predicates that are directly related to the possession of wood blocks and the resulting planks. Based on the given list of predicates, the relevant ones for this action are:

1. (HasWoodBlock ?agent - player ?wood - woodBlock)
2. (HasPlankBlock ?agent - player ?plank - plankBlock)

These predicates are necessary to check the precondition (having four wood blocks) and to define the effect (having four plank blocks) of the action.

### New Predicates
```
- (HasWoodBlock ?agent - player ?wood - woodBlock): 'Indicates that the player has a wood block.'
- (HasPlankBlock ?agent - player ?plank - plankBlock): 'Indicates that the player has a plank block.'
```

[STAGE FIVE OUTPUT]:
Here is the PDDL action for crafting wooden planks in Minecraft:

### Action Parameters
```
- ?agent - player: 'The player performing the crafting action'
- ?wood1 - woodBlock: 'The first wood block'
- ?wood2 - woodBlock: 'The second wood block'
- ?wood3 - woodBlock: 'The third wood block'
- ?wood4 - woodBlock: 'The fourth wood block'
- ?plank1 - plankBlock: 'The first resulting plank block'
- ?plank2 - plankBlock: 'The second resulting plank block'
- ?plank3 - plankBlock: 'The third resulting plank block'
- ?plank4 - plankBlock: 'The fourth resulting plank block'
```
