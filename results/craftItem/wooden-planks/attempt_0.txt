LLM OUTPUTS:

[STAGE ONE OUTPUT]:
The `craftItem` function automates the crafting process in Minecraft by directing a bot to craft a specified item a given number of times. It first identifies the item and locates a nearby crafting table. Then, the bot moves to the crafting table and retrieves the appropriate recipe for the item. Finally, it executes the crafting process using the recipe and the specified count.

[STAGE TWO OUTPUT]:
The goal is to automate item crafting; preconditions include a placed crafting table; effects are crafting the specified item the desired number of times.

[STAGE THREE OUTPUT]:
To create a simple PDDL action for crafting wooden planks in Minecraft, we need to identify the relevant types that are involved in the process. Based on the description of the action, the following types are relevant:

1. `player`: The player is the entity performing the crafting action.
2. `woodBlock`: This is the resource required to craft wooden planks. The player needs four of these to perform the action.
3. `plankBlock`: This is the result of the crafting action, where the player receives four planks.

The other types mentioned, such as `craftTable`, `stickItem`, `woodenSword`, `woodenPickaxe`, and `gridSquare`, are not needed for this specific action because the crafting of wooden planks does not require a crafting table or any other items.

## OUTPUT
{
    "player": "The entity performing the crafting action",
    "woodBlock": "The resource required to craft wooden planks",
    "plankBlock": "The result of the crafting action"
}

[STAGE FOUR OUTPUT]:
To create a simple PDDL action for crafting wooden planks, we need to consider the preconditions and effects of the action based on the given recipe and description. The precondition is that the player must have four individual wood blocks, and the effect is that the player ends up with four individual planks. Since no crafting table is needed, we can ignore predicates related to crafting tables.

From the list of predicates you provided, the relevant ones are:

- (HasWoodBlock ?agent - player ?wood - woodBlock): This predicate is necessary to check if the player has the required wood blocks to craft planks.
- (HasPlankBlock ?agent - player ?plank - plankBlock): This predicate is necessary to denote the effect of the action, which is that the player will have plank blocks after crafting.

Now, let's format the selected predicates in the specified format:

### New Predicates
```
- (HasWoodBlock ?agent - player ?wood - woodBlock): 'Indicates that the player has a wood block.'
- (HasPlankBlock ?agent - player ?plank - plankBlock): 'Indicates that the player has a plank block.'
```

[STAGE FIVE OUTPUT]:
Here is the PDDL action for crafting wooden planks in Minecraft:

### Action Parameters
```
- ?agent - player: 'The player performing the crafting action'
- ?wood1 - woodBlock: 'The first wood block'

- ?wood3 - woodBlock: 'The third wood block'
- ?wood4 - woodBlock: 'The fourth wood block'
- ?plank - plankBlock: 'The resulting plank block'
```

### Action Preconditions
```

    (HasWoodBlock ?agent ?wood1) ; Player has the first wood block
    (HasWoodBlock ?agent ?wood2) ; Player has the second wood block
    (HasWoodBlock ?agent ?wood3) ; Player has the third wood block
    (HasWoodBlock ?agent ?wood4) ; Player has the fourth wood block
    (not (= ?wood1 ?wood2)) ; Ensure distinct wood blocks
