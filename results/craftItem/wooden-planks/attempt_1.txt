LLM OUTPUTS:

[STAGE ONE OUTPUT]:
The `craftItem` function in JavaScript is designed to automate the crafting process in Minecraft by directing a bot to craft a specified item a certain number of times. It first identifies the crafting table within a 32-block radius, navigates the bot to face it, retrieves the appropriate recipe for the desired item, and then executes the crafting operation using the specified recipe and quantity.

[STAGE TWO OUTPUT]:
The goal is to automate item crafting; preconditions include a placed crafting table; effects are crafting the specified item quantity using the recipe.

[STAGE THREE OUTPUT]:
To create a simple PDDL wooden-planks action, we need to focus on the relevant types that are directly involved in the action of crafting wooden planks. Based on the given scenario, the types involved are the player, the woodBlock (as the raw material required for crafting), and the plankBlock (as the resulting item from the crafting process). Since no crafting table is needed for this action, we do not include the craftTable type. Here is the output with the relevant types and their descriptions:

## OUTPUT
{
    "player": "The entity executing the crafting action.",
    "woodBlock": "The raw material required for crafting wooden planks.",
    "plankBlock": "The resulting item from the crafting process."
}

[STAGE FOUR OUTPUT]:
To create a simple PDDL action for crafting wooden planks based on the given recipe and preconditions, we need to select predicates that relate to the agent having wood blocks and the resulting effect of having plank blocks. From the list provided, the relevant predicates are:

1. `(HasWoodBlock ?agent - player ?wood - woodBlock)` - This predicate is necessary to check the precondition that the agent has four individual wood blocks.

2. `(HasPlankBlock ?agent - player ?plank - plankBlock)` - This predicate is used to represent the effect of the action, which is the agent having four individual plank blocks.

### New Predicates
```
- (HasWoodBlock ?agent - player ?wood - woodBlock): 'The agent has a wood block.'
- (HasPlankBlock ?agent - player ?plank - plankBlock): 'The agent has a plank block.'
```

[STAGE FIVE OUTPUT]:
Here is the PDDL action for crafting wooden planks in Minecraft based on the provided information:

### Action Parameters
```
- ?agent - player: 'The player performing the crafting action'
- ?wood1 - woodBlock: 'First wood block'
- ?wood2 - woodBlock: 'Second wood block'

- ?wood4 - woodBlock: 'Fourth wood block'
- ?plank1 - plankBlock: 'First resulting plank block'
- ?plank2 - plankBlock: 'Second resulting plank block'
- ?plank3 - plankBlock: 'Third resulting plank block'
- ?plank4 - plankBlock: 'Fourth resulting plank block'
```
