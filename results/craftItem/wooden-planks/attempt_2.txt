LLM OUTPUTS:

[STAGE ONE OUTPUT]:
The `craftItem` function automates the crafting process in Minecraft by directing a bot to craft a specified item a certain number of times using a crafting table. It first identifies the item and locates the nearest crafting table within a 32-block radius. The bot then moves to the crafting table and executes the crafting recipe for the desired item and quantity.

[STAGE TWO OUTPUT]:
The goal is to craft a specified item using a crafting table; preconditions include having a placed crafting table; effects are crafting the item.

[STAGE THREE OUTPUT]:
To create a simple PDDL action for crafting wooden planks in Minecraft, we need to consider the elements involved in the action. The action requires a player, wood blocks, and the resulting planks. Since no crafting table is needed for this action, we can exclude it. Here's a breakdown of the types needed:

1. **player**: Represents the player who is performing the crafting action.
2. **woodBlock**: Represents the wood blocks that are used as input for crafting the planks.
3. **plankBlock**: Represents the planks that are the result of the crafting action.

Based on these considerations, the relevant types are `player`, `woodBlock`, and `plankBlock`. 

## OUTPUT
```python
{
    "player": "Represents the player performing the crafting action",
    "woodBlock": "Represents the wood blocks used as input for crafting",
    "plankBlock": "Represents the wooden planks that are crafted",
}
```

[STAGE FOUR OUTPUT]:
To create a simple PDDL action for crafting wooden planks from wood blocks in Minecraft, you need to focus on the predicates that are directly related to the possession of wood blocks and planks. Given the recipe and preconditions, the relevant predicates from the list are:

1. (HasWoodBlock ?agent - player ?wood - woodBlock): This predicate is necessary to check if the player has the required wood blocks as a precondition for crafting wooden planks.

2. (HasPlankBlock ?agent - player ?plank - plankBlock): This predicate is necessary to represent the effect of the action, which is the player obtaining plank blocks after crafting.

These are the only predicates needed from the provided list to define the action of crafting wooden planks, as no crafting table is required and the action is focused solely on the transformation of wood blocks into plank blocks.

### New Predicates
```
- (HasWoodBlock ?agent - player ?wood - woodBlock): 'Represents that the player has a certain number of wood blocks.'
- (HasPlankBlock ?agent - player ?plank - plankBlock): 'Represents that the player has a certain number of plank blocks after crafting.'
```

[STAGE FIVE OUTPUT]:
Here is the PDDL action for crafting wooden planks in Minecraft:
