[STAGE ONE OUTPUT]:
The `craftItem` function automates the crafting process in Minecraft by directing a bot to craft a specified item using a crafting table. It first identifies the item and locates the nearest crafting table within a 32-block radius. The bot then moves to face the crafting table and retrieves the appropriate recipe for the item. Finally, it executes the crafting operation for the specified number of times.

[STAGE TWO OUTPUT]:
The `craftItem` function aims to automate item crafting by requiring a nearby crafting table and results in the bot crafting the specified item.

[STAGE THREE OUTPUT]:
To create a simple PDDL action for crafting wooden planks in Minecraft, we need to consider the types involved in the action. The action involves a player using wood blocks to craft planks. Since no crafting table is needed, we can exclude the `craftTable` type. The relevant types for this action are `player`, `woodBlock`, and `plankBlock`. Here's the breakdown:

1. **player**: Represents the entity performing the crafting action.
2. **woodBlock**: Represents the input material needed to craft planks.
3. **plankBlock**: Represents the output product of the crafting action.

These types are essential for defining the preconditions and effects of the action in PDDL. 

## OUTPUT
{
    "player": "Represents the entity performing the crafting action",
    "woodBlock": "Represents the input material needed to craft planks",
    "plankBlock": "Represents the output product of the crafting action"
}

[STAGE FOUR OUTPUT]:
Based on the given predicates and the requirements for crafting wooden planks in Minecraft, the relevant predicates needed to define the action are those that involve the player having wood blocks and plank blocks. The crafting process described does not require a crafting table, so predicates related to crafting tables are not necessary. Here are the selected predicates:

- (HasWoodBlock ?agent - player ?wood - woodBlock)
- (HasPlankBlock ?agent - player ?plank - plankBlock)

### New Predicates
```
- (HasWoodBlock ?agent - player ?wood - woodBlock): 'Indicates the player has a wood block'
- (HasPlankBlock ?agent - player ?plank - plankBlock): 'Indicates the player has a plank block'
```

[STAGE FIVE OUTPUT]:
To create a PDDL action for crafting wooden planks in Minecraft, we need to define the action parameters, preconditions, and effects based on the provided types and predicates. The action will ensure that the player has four distinct wood blocks and will result in the player having four plank blocks. Here's how the action is structured:

### Action Parameters
```
- ?agent - player: 'The player performing the crafting action'
- ?wood1 - woodBlock: 'The first wood block'
- ?wood2 - woodBlock: 'The second wood block'
- ?wood3 - woodBlock: 'The third wood block'
- ?wood4 - woodBlock: 'The fourth wood block'
- ?plank1 - plankBlock: 'The first resulting plank block'
- ?plank2 - plankBlock: 'The second resulting plank block'
- ?plank3 - plankBlock: 'The third resulting plank block'
- ?plank4 - plankBlock: 'The fourth resulting plank block'
```

### Action Preconditions
```
(and
    (HasWoodBlock ?agent ?wood1) ; The player has the first wood block
    (HasWoodBlock ?agent ?wood2) ; The player has the second wood block
    (HasWoodBlock ?agent ?wood3) ; The player has the third wood block
    (HasWoodBlock ?agent ?wood4) ; The player has the fourth wood block
    (not (= ?wood1 ?wood2)) ; Ensure the first and second wood blocks are distinct
    (not (= ?wood1 ?wood3)) ; Ensure the first and third wood blocks are distinct
    (not (= ?wood1 ?wood4)) ; Ensure the first and fourth wood blocks are distinct
    (not (= ?wood2 ?wood3)) ; Ensure the second and third wood blocks are distinct
    (not (= ?wood2 ?wood4)) ; Ensure the second and fourth wood blocks are distinct
    (not (= ?wood3 ?wood4)) ; Ensure the third and fourth wood blocks are distinct
)
```

### Action Effects
```
(and
    (not (HasWoodBlock ?agent ?wood1)) ; The player no longer has the first wood block
    (not (HasWoodBlock ?agent ?wood2)) ; The player no longer has the second wood block
    (not (HasWoodBlock ?agent ?wood3)) ; The player no longer has the third wood block
    (not (HasWoodBlock ?agent ?wood4)) ; The player no longer has the fourth wood block
    (HasPlankBlock ?agent ?plank1) ; The player has the first plank block
    (HasPlankBlock ?agent ?plank2) ; The player has the second plank block
    (HasPlankBlock ?agent ?plank3) ; The player has the third plank block
    (HasPlankBlock ?agent ?plank4) ; The player has the fourth plank block
)
```

### New Predicates
```

``` 

This action ensures that the player has four distinct wood blocks before crafting and results in the player having four plank blocks, with the wood blocks being consumed in the process.
