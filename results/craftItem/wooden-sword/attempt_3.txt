[STAGE ONE OUTPUT]:
The `craftItem` function automates the crafting process in Minecraft by directing a bot to craft a specified item. It first identifies the item and locates a nearby crafting table. The bot then navigates to the crafting table and uses the appropriate recipe to craft the desired quantity of the item. The function assumes that a crafting table is already placed within a 32-block radius.

[STAGE TWO OUTPUT]:
The `craftItem` function aims to automate item crafting by directing a bot to locate a nearby crafting table and execute a recipe, assuming a table is pre-placed.

[STAGE THREE OUTPUT]:
To create a simple PDDL wooden-sword action, we need to consider the types that are directly involved in the crafting process. Based on the given recipe and the generic Minecraft action summary, the relevant types would be:

1. **player**: The entity performing the crafting action.
2. **craftTable**: The object required to perform the crafting action.
3. **plankBlock**: The material required to craft the wooden sword.
4. **stickItem**: Another material required to craft the wooden sword.
5. **woodenSword**: The result of the crafting action.

These types are essential to define the preconditions and effects of the action in PDDL. The player needs to have the necessary materials (plankBlock and stickItem) and access to a craftTable to produce a woodenSword.

## OUTPUT
```python
{
    "player": "The entity performing the crafting action",
    "craftTable": "The object required to perform the crafting action",
    "plankBlock": "The material required to craft the wooden sword",
    "stickItem": "Another material required to craft the wooden sword",
    "woodenSword": "The result of the crafting action"
}
```

[STAGE FOUR OUTPUT]:
Based on the given recipe for crafting a wooden sword in Minecraft and the description of the `craftItem` function, the necessary predicates from the provided list are:

1. (HasPlankBlock ?agent - player ?plank - plankBlock): This predicate is needed because the player must have two planks to craft a wooden sword.

2. (HasStickItem ?agent - player ?stick - stickItem): This predicate is needed because the player must have one stick to craft a wooden sword.

3. (HasCraftTable ?agent - player ?table - craftTable): This predicate is required because the player must have a crafting table to execute the crafting action.

4. (HasWoodenSword ?agent - player ?sword - woodenSword): This predicate represents the effect of the action, where the player will have a wooden sword after crafting.
