LLM OUTPUTS:

[STAGE ONE OUTPUT]:
The `craftItem` function automates the crafting process in Minecraft by directing a bot to craft a specified item a certain number of times. It first identifies the required item and locates a nearby crafting table. The bot then navigates to the crafting table and uses the appropriate recipe to craft the item the specified number of times.

[STAGE TWO OUTPUT]:
The goal is to automate crafting items using a bot, with the precondition of a nearby crafting table, and the effect is crafting the specified item.

[STAGE THREE OUTPUT]:
To create a simple PDDL action for crafting a wooden sword in Minecraft, we need to identify the types that are relevant to the crafting process. Based on the given recipe and conditions, we can determine the necessary types as follows:

1. **player**: Represents the player character who will perform the crafting action.
2. **craftTable**: Represents the crafting table, which is a required object for crafting a wooden sword.
3. **plankBlock**: Represents the planks needed for crafting the wooden sword.
4. **stickItem**: Represents the stick needed for crafting the wooden sword.
5. **woodenSword**: Represents the output item, which is the wooden sword.

These types are essential for defining the preconditions and effects of the crafting action in PDDL. The player interacts with the crafting table using planks and a stick to produce a wooden sword.

## OUTPUT
```python
{
    "player": "Represents the player character who performs the crafting action",
    "craftTable": "Represents the crafting table required for crafting",
    "plankBlock": "Represents the planks needed for crafting the wooden sword",
    "stickItem": "Represents the stick needed for crafting the wooden sword",
    "woodenSword": "Represents the output item, the wooden sword",
}
```

[STAGE FOUR OUTPUT]:
Based on the provided predicates and the requirements for crafting a wooden sword, the necessary predicates are:

1. The player must have two planks.
2. The player must have one stick.
3. The player must have a crafting table.
4. The effect is that the player will have a wooden sword.

Therefore, the predicates needed are:

- (HasPlankBlock ?agent - player ?plank - plankBlock)
- (HasStickItem ?agent - player ?stick - stickItem)
- (HasCraftTable ?agent - player ?table - craftTable)
- (HasWoodenSword ?agent - player ?sword - woodenSword)

### New Predicates
```
- (HasPlankBlock ?agent - player ?plank - plankBlock): 'The agent has a plank block.'
- (HasStickItem ?agent - player ?stick - stickItem): 'The agent has a stick item.'
- (HasCraftTable ?agent - player ?table - craftTable): 'The agent has a crafting table.'
- (HasWoodenSword ?agent - player ?sword - woodenSword): 'The agent has a wooden sword.'
```
