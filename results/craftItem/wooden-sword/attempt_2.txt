LLM OUTPUTS:

[STAGE ONE OUTPUT]:
The `craftItem` function is an asynchronous JavaScript function for a Minecraft bot that crafts a specified item using a crafting table. It locates a crafting table within a 32-block radius, navigates the bot to face the table, retrieves the appropriate crafting recipe for the item, and then executes the crafting process for the specified quantity.

[STAGE TWO OUTPUT]:
The goal is to craft a specified item; preconditions include having a crafting table placed; effects are the bot crafts the item using the table.

[STAGE THREE OUTPUT]:
To create a simple PDDL action for crafting a wooden sword in Minecraft, we need to identify the relevant types based on the given action summary and requirements. Specifically, we need to consider the types that are directly involved in the crafting process, such as the player, crafting table, planks, and stick. Here's the breakdown:

1. **player**: Represents the entity performing the action. This is essential as the player needs to have the items and execute the crafting action.

2. **craftTable**: Needed because the player must use a crafting table to craft a wooden sword.

3. **plankBlock**: Represents the planks required for crafting the sword. Since the recipe requires two planks, this type is necessary.

4. **stickItem**: Represents the stick required for crafting the sword. This is also essential for the recipe.

5. **woodenSword**: Represents the output of the crafting action. The goal is to produce a wooden sword.

Based on these considerations, the relevant types are: player, craftTable, plankBlock, stickItem, and woodenSword.

## OUTPUT
{
    "player": "Represents the entity performing the action.",
    "craftTable": "Needed for crafting the wooden sword.",
    "plankBlock": "Represents the planks required for the recipe.",
    "stickItem": "Represents the stick required for the recipe.",
    "woodenSword": "Represents the output of the crafting action."
}

[STAGE FOUR OUTPUT]:
Based on the given requirements for crafting a wooden sword in Minecraft, the necessary predicates from the list are:

1. The player must have two planks.
2. The player must have one stick.
3. The player must have a crafting table.
4. The effect is that the player has a wooden sword.

From the provided list of predicates, the ones relevant to these requirements are:

- `(HasPlankBlock ?agent - player ?plank - plankBlock)` - This is used to check if the player has planks.
- `(HasStickItem ?agent - player ?stick - stickItem)` - This is used to check if the player has a stick.
- `(HasCraftTable ?agent - player ?table - craftTable)` - This is used to ensure the player has a crafting table available.
- `(HasWoodenSword ?agent - player ?sword - woodenSword)` - This is used to denote the effect where the player obtains a wooden sword.
