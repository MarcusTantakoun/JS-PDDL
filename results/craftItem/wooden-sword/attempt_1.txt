LLM OUTPUTS:

[STAGE ONE OUTPUT]:
The `craftItem` function automates the crafting process in Minecraft by directing a bot to craft a specified item. It first identifies the crafting table within a 32-block radius and navigates the bot to face it. The function then retrieves the appropriate recipe for the desired item and executes the crafting operation the specified number of times.

[STAGE TWO OUTPUT]:
The goal is to automate crafting; preconditions are having a crafting table placed; effects are crafting the specified item using the bot.

[STAGE THREE OUTPUT]:
To create a simple PDDL action for crafting a wooden sword in Minecraft, we need to consider the types that are involved in the process. The action requires a player, a crafting table, two planks, and one stick. The result of the action is a wooden sword. Therefore, the relevant types from the provided list are:

1. `player`: This type is needed because the player is the one performing the crafting action.
2. `craftTable`: This type is needed because the crafting action requires a crafting table to be executed.
3. `plankBlock`: This type is needed because two planks are required as part of the recipe for crafting a wooden sword.
4. `stickItem`: This type is needed because one stick is required as part of the recipe for crafting a wooden sword.
5. `woodenSword`: This type is needed as it represents the outcome of the crafting action.

Based on these considerations, the types we need to include are `player`, `craftTable`, `plankBlock`, `stickItem`, and `woodenSword`.

## OUTPUT
{
    "player": "The entity performing the crafting action.",
    "craftTable": "The object necessary to perform crafting actions.",
    "plankBlock": "A component of the wooden sword recipe.",
    "stickItem": "A component of the wooden sword recipe.",
    "woodenSword": "The result of the crafting action."
}
