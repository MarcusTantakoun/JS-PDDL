[STAGE ONE OUTPUT]:
The `craftItem` function automates the crafting process in Minecraft by directing a bot to craft a specified item a given number of times. It first identifies the item and locates a nearby crafting table within a 32-block radius. The bot then navigates to the crafting table and executes the crafting recipe for the specified item using the provided count.

[STAGE TWO OUTPUT]:
The `craftItem` function aims to automate item crafting, requiring a nearby crafting table, and results in the bot crafting the specified item multiple times.

[STAGE THREE OUTPUT]:
To create a simple PDDL action for crafting a wooden sword in Minecraft, we need to consider the types that are directly involved in the crafting process. Based on the provided information, the relevant types are:

1. **player**: Represents the entity performing the crafting action.
2. **craftTable**: Required to execute the crafting action.
3. **plankBlock**: Represents the material needed for crafting the wooden sword.
4. **stickItem**: Another material required for crafting the wooden sword.
5. **woodenSword**: The resulting item from the crafting action.

These types are essential for defining the preconditions and effects of the crafting action in PDDL. Here's the output in the specified format:

## OUTPUT
```python
{
    "player": "The entity performing the crafting action.",
    "craftTable": "Required to execute the crafting action.",
    "plankBlock": "Material needed for crafting the wooden sword.",
    "stickItem": "Material needed for crafting the wooden sword.",
    "woodenSword": "The resulting item from the crafting action."
}
```

[STAGE FOUR OUTPUT]:
Based on the requirements for crafting a wooden sword in Minecraft, the relevant predicates from the list provided are:

1. The player must have two planks.
2. The player must have one stick.
3. The player must have a crafting table.
4. The effect of the action is that the player has a wooden sword.

Therefore, the predicates you would need are:

- (HasPlankBlock ?agent - player ?plank - plankBlock)
- (HasStickItem ?agent - player ?stick - stickItem)
- (HasCraftTable ?agent - player ?table - craftTable)
- (HasWoodenSword ?agent - player ?sword - woodenSword)
