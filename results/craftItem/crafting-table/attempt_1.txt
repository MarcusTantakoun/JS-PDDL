LLM OUTPUTS:

[STAGE ONE OUTPUT]:
The `craftItem` function allows a Minecraft bot to craft a specified item by locating a crafting table within a 32-block radius and using the appropriate recipe. It navigates the bot to face the crafting table and then executes the crafting process for the given item and quantity. The function requires the item name and optionally the count of how many times to perform the crafting operation.

[STAGE TWO OUTPUT]:
The goal is to craft a specified item; preconditions include a placed crafting table within 32 blocks; effects are the crafted item and quantity.

[STAGE THREE OUTPUT]:
To create a simple PDDL action for crafting a crafting table in Minecraft, we need to focus on the elements involved in the action and their roles. The action involves a player using planks to craft a crafting table. Here's how we can break it down:

1. **player**: Represents the entity performing the action, i.e., the player.
2. **plankBlock**: Represents the resource required to perform the action, i.e., the planks needed to craft the table.
3. **craftTable**: Represents the outcome of the action, i.e., the crafting table that is created.

Given this understanding, we can define the types involved in the action:

- **player**: The entity that performs the crafting action.
- **plankBlock**: The resource needed as a precondition to perform the crafting action.
- **craftTable**: The result of the crafting action.

Now, let's provide the output in the specified format:

## OUTPUT
{
    "player": "The entity performing the crafting action",
    "plankBlock": "The resource required to craft the crafting table",
    "craftTable": "The result of the crafting action"
}

[STAGE FOUR OUTPUT]:
To create a simple PDDL action for crafting a crafting table, we need to identify the relevant predicates from the provided list that align with the preconditions and effects of the crafting action. The precondition requires the player to have 4 individual planks, and the effect is that the player has one crafting table. Based on this, the relevant predicates are:

1. **(HasPlankBlock ?agent - player ?plank - plankBlock):** This predicate is necessary to check if the player has the required planks to craft the crafting table.

2. **(HasCraftTable ?agent - player ?table - craftTable):** This predicate represents the effect of the action, which is that the player will have a crafting table after the action is performed.

Here are the selected predicates with their descriptions:

### New Predicates
```
- (HasPlankBlock ?agent - player ?plank - plankBlock): 'Indicates that the player has a plank block, which is a precondition for crafting a crafting table.'
- (HasCraftTable ?agent - player ?table - craftTable): 'Indicates that the player has a crafting table, which is the effect of crafting the table.'
```

[STAGE FIVE OUTPUT]:
Here is the PDDL action for crafting a crafting table in Minecraft:

### Action Parameters
```
- ?agent - player: 'The player who is attempting to craft the crafting table.'
- ?plank1 - plankBlock: 'The first plank block used in crafting.'
- ?plank2 - plankBlock: 'The second plank block used in crafting.'
- ?plank3 - plankBlock: 'The third plank block used in crafting.'
- ?plank4 - plankBlock: 'The fourth plank block used in crafting.'
- ?table - craftTable: 'The resulting crafting table.'
```

### Action Preconditions
```
(and
    (HasPlankBlock ?agent ?plank1) ; The player has the first plank block.
    (HasPlankBlock ?agent ?plank2) ; The player has the second plank block.

    (HasPlankBlock ?agent ?plank4) ; The player has the fourth plank block.
    (not (= ?plank1 ?plank2)) ; Ensure the first and second planks are distinct.
    (not (= ?plank1 ?plank3)) ; Ensure the first and third planks are distinct.

    (not (= ?plank2 ?plank4)) ; Ensure the second and fourth planks are distinct.
    (not (= ?plank3 ?plank4)) ; Ensure the third and fourth planks are distinct.
)
```

### Action Effects
```
