LLM OUTPUTS:

[STAGE ONE OUTPUT]:
The `craftItem` function automates the crafting process in Minecraft by directing a bot to craft a specified item using a crafting table. It first identifies the crafting table within a 32-block radius and navigates the bot to focus on it. Then, it retrieves the appropriate recipe for the desired item and executes the crafting process for the specified quantity.

[STAGE TWO OUTPUT]:
The goal is to automate crafting items using a crafting table; preconditions include having a placed crafting table; effects are the bot crafts specified items.

[STAGE THREE OUTPUT]:
To create a simple PDDL action for crafting a crafting table in Minecraft, we need to consider the elements involved in the crafting process. Based on the provided information, the relevant types would be:

1. **player**: This represents the entity performing the crafting action. The player needs to have the required materials and interact with the crafting table.

2. **plankBlock**: This represents the individual planks needed as a precondition for crafting the crafting table. The player must have four of these.

3. **craftTable**: This represents the item that is created as a result of the crafting action. The effect of the action is that a crafting table is produced.

Given this information, here is the appropriate Python dictionary:

## OUTPUT
{
    "player": "the entity performing the crafting action",
    "plankBlock": "the individual planks needed to craft a crafting table",
    "craftTable": "the item produced as a result of the crafting action"
}

[STAGE FOUR OUTPUT]:
Based on the given recipe for crafting a crafting table in Minecraft, you need to ensure the player has 4 individual planks as a precondition. The effect of the action is that the player will have one crafting table. Therefore, the relevant predicates from the list are:

1. (HasPlankBlock ?agent - player ?plank - plankBlock)
2. (HasCraftTable ?agent - player ?table - craftTable)

### New Predicates
```
- (HasPlankBlock ?agent - player ?plank - plankBlock): 'Indicates the player has a plank block.'
- (HasCraftTable ?agent - player ?table - craftTable): 'Indicates the player has a crafting table.'
```

[STAGE FIVE OUTPUT]:
Here is the PDDL action for crafting a crafting table in Minecraft using the specified types and predicates:

### Action Parameters
```
- ?agent - player: 'The player performing the crafting action'
- ?plank1 - plankBlock: 'The first plank block'
- ?plank2 - plankBlock: 'The second plank block'
- ?plank3 - plankBlock: 'The third plank block'
- ?plank4 - plankBlock: 'The fourth plank block'
- ?table - craftTable: 'The resulting crafting table'
```

### Action Preconditions
```

    (not (= ?plank2 ?plank3)) ; Ensure the second and third planks are distinct
    (not (= ?plank2 ?plank4)) ; Ensure the second and fourth planks are distinct
    (not (= ?plank3 ?plank4)) ; Ensure the third and fourth planks are distinct
)
```

### Action Effects
```
