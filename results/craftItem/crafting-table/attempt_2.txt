[STAGE ONE OUTPUT]:
The `craftItem` function automates crafting a specified item using a Minecraft bot. It first identifies the item and locates a nearby crafting table within a 32-block radius. The bot then navigates to the crafting table, retrieves the appropriate recipe for the item, and crafts the specified quantity using the table.

[STAGE TWO OUTPUT]:
The `craftItem` function aims to automate crafting items by requiring a nearby crafting table and results in the bot crafting the specified item quantity.

[STAGE THREE OUTPUT]:
To create a simple PDDL action for crafting a crafting table in Minecraft, we need to consider the types involved in the preconditions and effects of the action. Based on the provided information, the relevant types would be:

1. **player**: The entity performing the action.
2. **plankBlock**: The resource required to perform the action.
3. **craftTable**: The result of the action.

Here's how these types fit into the crafting action:

- **player**: The player is the one who performs the crafting action.
- **plankBlock**: The player needs to have 4 plank blocks to craft a crafting table.
- **craftTable**: The result of the action is that the player has a crafting table.

Given this, the types needed for the PDDL action are `player`, `plankBlock`, and `craftTable`.

## OUTPUT
```python
{
    "player": "The entity performing the crafting action",
    "plankBlock": "The resource required to craft the crafting table",
    "craftTable": "The result of the crafting action"
}
```

[STAGE FOUR OUTPUT]:
Based on the provided information and the crafting recipe for a crafting table in Minecraft, the relevant predicates from the list are:

- (HasPlankBlock ?agent - player ?plank - plankBlock)
- (HasCraftTable ?agent - player ?table - craftTable)

These predicates are necessary because the precondition requires the player to have 4 individual planks, and the effect is that the player has one craft table.

### New Predicates
```
- (HasPlankBlock ?agent - player ?plank - plankBlock): 'Indicates that the player has a plank block.'
- (HasCraftTable ?agent - player ?table - craftTable): 'Indicates that the player has a crafting table.'
```

[STAGE FIVE OUTPUT]:
Here is the PDDL action for crafting a crafting table in Minecraft:

### Action Parameters
```
- ?agent - player: 'The player who is crafting the crafting table.'
- ?plank1 - plankBlock: 'The first plank block used in crafting.'
- ?plank2 - plankBlock: 'The second plank block used in crafting.'

- ?plank4 - plankBlock: 'The fourth plank block used in crafting.'
- ?table - craftTable: 'The resulting crafting table.'
```

### Action Preconditions

)
```

### Action Effects
