LLM OUTPUTS:

[STAGE ONE OUTPUT]:
The `craftItem` function automates the process of crafting a specified item in Minecraft using a bot. It first identifies the item to be crafted and locates a nearby crafting table. The bot then navigates to the crafting table and retrieves the appropriate recipe for the item. Finally, it executes the crafting process the specified number of times using the recipe and crafting table.

[STAGE TWO OUTPUT]:
The goal is to automate item crafting; preconditions include having a crafting table placed; effects are crafting the specified item using the bot.

[STAGE THREE OUTPUT]:
To create a simple PDDL action for crafting a crafting table in Minecraft, we need to consider the types that are relevant to the action as described. The action involves a player, the crafting table to be created, and the planks required as a precondition. Based on the provided types and the context of the action, the relevant types are:

1. **player**: Represents the player who is performing the crafting action.
2. **craftTable**: Represents the crafting table that is the result of the crafting action.
3. **plankBlock**: Represents the planks needed as a precondition for crafting the crafting table.

These types are essential to represent the entities involved in the crafting process. Here's the final output with the types and their descriptions:

## OUTPUT
```python
{
    "player": "Represents the player performing the action",
    "craftTable": "Represents the crafting table being created",
    "plankBlock": "Represents the planks needed for crafting"
}
```

[STAGE FOUR OUTPUT]:
Based on the given recipe for crafting a crafting table in Minecraft and the generic crafting action described, the relevant predicates from the list provided are:

1. (HasPlankBlock ?agent - player ?plank - plankBlock): This predicate is necessary because the precondition for crafting a crafting table is that the player must have 4 planks.

2. (HasCraftTable ?agent - player ?table - craftTable): This predicate is necessary to represent the effect of the action, which is that the player will have a crafting table after the action is executed.

Here's how the selected predicates would be formatted in the PDDL comment block:

### New Predicates
```
- (HasPlankBlock ?agent - player ?plank - plankBlock): 'Indicates that a player has a certain number of plank blocks, which are needed to craft a crafting table.'
- (HasCraftTable ?agent - player ?table - craftTable): 'Indicates that a player has a crafting table, which is the result of the crafting action.'
```

[STAGE FIVE OUTPUT]:
Here is the PDDL action for crafting a crafting table in Minecraft:

### Action Parameters
```
- ?agent - player: 'The player who is crafting the crafting table'
- ?plank1 - plankBlock: 'The first plank block used for crafting the table'
- ?plank2 - plankBlock: 'The second plank block used for crafting the table'
- ?plank3 - plankBlock: 'The third plank block used for crafting the table'
- ?plank4 - plankBlock: 'The fourth plank block used for crafting the table'
- ?table - craftTable: 'The crafting table that will be created as a result of the action'
```

### Action Preconditions
```
(and
    (HasPlankBlock ?agent ?plank1) ; The player has the first plank block
    (HasPlankBlock ?agent ?plank2) ; The player has the second plank block
    (HasPlankBlock ?agent ?plank3) ; The player has the third plank block
    (HasPlankBlock ?agent ?plank4) ; The player has the fourth plank block
    (not (= ?plank1 ?plank2))      ; The first and second planks are distinct
    (not (= ?plank1 ?plank3))      ; The first and third planks are distinct
    (not (= ?plank1 ?plank4))      ; The first and fourth planks are distinct
    (not (= ?plank2 ?plank3))      ; The second and third planks are distinct
    (not (= ?plank2 ?plank4))      ; The second and fourth planks are distinct
    (not (= ?plank3 ?plank4))      ; The third and fourth planks are distinct
)
```

### Action Effects
```
(and
    (HasCraftTable ?agent ?table) ; The player now has a crafting table
    ; Optionally, remove the plank blocks if they are consumed in the process
    (not (HasPlankBlock ?agent ?plank1))
    (not (HasPlankBlock ?agent ?plank2))
    (not (HasPlankBlock ?agent ?plank3))
    (not (HasPlankBlock ?agent ?plank4))
)
