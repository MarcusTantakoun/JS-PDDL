[STAGE ONE OUTPUT]:
The `craftItem` function allows a Minecraft bot to craft a specified item using a crafting table. It first identifies the item and locates a nearby crafting table within a 32-block radius. The bot then navigates to the crafting table, retrieves the appropriate recipe for the item, and crafts the specified quantity of the item using the recipe.

[STAGE TWO OUTPUT]:
The `craftItem` function aims to craft a specified item using a crafting table, requiring a nearby crafting table and resulting in the crafted item.

[STAGE THREE OUTPUT]:
To create a simple PDDL action for crafting a crafting table in Minecraft, we need to consider the types that are relevant to the action. Based on the provided summary and the types available, we can identify the following types as necessary:

1. **player**: Represents the player who is performing the crafting action.
2. **plankBlock**: Represents the individual planks required to craft the crafting table.
3. **craftTable**: Represents the crafting table that is the result of the crafting action.

These types are essential for defining the preconditions and effects of the crafting action in PDDL. Here's the final output in the specified format:

## OUTPUT
```python
{
    "player": "Represents the player performing the crafting action",
    "plankBlock": "Represents the individual planks required for crafting",
    "craftTable": "Represents the crafting table that is crafted",
}
```

[STAGE FOUR OUTPUT]:
Based on the given recipe for crafting a crafting table in Minecraft, the relevant predicates from the list provided are those that check for the presence of planks and the resulting possession of a crafting table. The necessary predicates are:

1. (HasPlankBlock ?agent - player ?plank - plankBlock) - This predicate is needed to check if the player has the required planks to craft the table.
2. (HasCraftTable ?agent - player ?table - craftTable) - This predicate is needed to represent the effect of the crafting action, which is the player obtaining a crafting table.

### New Predicates
```
- (HasPlankBlock ?agent - player ?plank - plankBlock): 'Indicates the player has a plank block, which is a precondition for crafting a crafting table.'
- (HasCraftTable ?agent - player ?table - craftTable): 'Indicates the player has a crafting table, which is the result of the crafting action.'
```

[STAGE FIVE OUTPUT]:
Here is the PDDL action for crafting a crafting table in Minecraft:

### Action Parameters
```
- ?agent - player: 'The player who is crafting the crafting table.'
- ?plank1 - plankBlock: 'The first plank block required for crafting.'

- ?plank4 - plankBlock: 'The fourth plank block required for crafting.'
- ?table - craftTable: 'The resulting crafting table.'
```

### Action Preconditions
```

    (not (= ?plank2 ?plank3)) ; Ensure the second and third planks are distinct.
    (not (= ?plank2 ?plank4)) ; Ensure the second and fourth planks are distinct.
    (not (= ?plank3 ?plank4)) ; Ensure the third and fourth planks are distinct.
)
```

### Action Effects
