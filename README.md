## Recreation
This Github recreates the major components of what we coin "JS-PDDL" framework where the LLM decomposes natural language information from operational models via Javascript functions. This then translates it into action PDDL specifications.

Specifically, this recreation only tests out the Minecraft domain â€“ `craftItem` Javascript operational function model; which is then deconstructed into (4) actions:
- crafting-table
- sticks
- wooden-planks
- wooden-sword
